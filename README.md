# Game Setup
### If your reef falls off, it will respawn. However, it respawns very quickly so be aware!
    The game is a single player brick-breaker like game. The game will begin after 
    the built in 3 second timer is over. The objective is to try to take out the 3 
    big leg squids in the game while also trying to score as many points as possible. 
    There is a lives and score tracker.
    You control the Katch left and right, while trying to bounce the reef on you to
    destroy the blocks. Each color block is worth a different amount.
    You are given a 3 lives at the start at the game.
    There are 2 blocks you can destory to gain an advantage when killing the big legs.
    
    There is a Health brick that gives you +1 lives.
    There is a Star Brick that multiplies your current score x2 everytime you destroy it!

### NOTE: ONCE THE BIG LEGS ARE ALL GONE, THE GAME WILL EXIT AUTOMATICALLY.
### NOTE: ONCE YOU LIVES ARE ALL GONE, THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN WILL READ 'GAME OVER'.
